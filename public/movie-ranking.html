<h1>Nikhil's Best Movies List 2023</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies this year</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>Very fun watch with an interesting villain and movie concept</p>
<h3>2. The Super Mario Movie</h3>
<p>Pretty funny and enjoyable</p>
<h3>3. John Wick Chapter 4</h3>
<p>A cool and intense movie but it does fail to keep up the stakes of the previous one</p>
